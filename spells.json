Of course, you or your players may want to try something not covered by those effects, such as temporarily repairing a weapon so that you can continue to wield it. In this case, you may set a difficulty by looking at the difficulty to repair the item (see Table I.5-4: Repairing Gear, on page 89).

The most extreme afflictions might even bend a victim to the spellcaster's will. The distinction between affliction and attack might not always be clear. As a general principle, if a magical action inflicts damage or strain, it's an attack. If it simply makes a target more susceptible to damage or strain, it's a curse.","Outside of structured encounters, curses could take any number of forms. Some could be annoying, such as someone sneezing uncontrollably or feeling inexplicably lethargic. The effects could be represented mechanically by adding a {@dice setback} or two to the target's checks. The check to inflict such a minor curse should either be opposed (see page 25), or {@difficulty easy} if the target is a minor character. Other curses could be more dangerous, such as a hex that causes dangerous things to happen to the target for no reason (ladders breaking, tree branches falling on them, and the like). Not only should the difficulty of the spell be higherâ€”if it's not an opposed check, it should be at least {@difficulty average} and possibly {@difficulty hard} â€” but the effects can be represented narratively. If a character falls from a broken ladder, for example, use the falling rules on page 112.","Of course, there are some truly terrible curses: blindness, disease, madness, or being turned into a toad. These checks should almost always be opposed (either by the target's Discipline or Resilience, depending on whether the curse affects the mind or the body).

The most powerful spells might cure deadly diseases or even raise the dead. Healing magic works much like the Medicine skill, but of course medicine in most fantasy worlds is fairly primitive.","In game terms, healing magic is more difficult than an equivalent Medicine check. However, in exchange for this increased difficulty, healing magic can do things that a skilled doctor cannot. These include healing targets from afar, healing multiple targets at once, and on rare occasions, bringing the deceased back from the dead. Healing magic can also affect targets multiple times per encounter.","When using healing magic, the additional affects listed in {@table |III.2-11} should cover most of what you want to do in narrative time as well as structured time. For other effectsâ€”such as a spell to double the rate of natural healing for a targetâ€”you, the GM, can set the difficulty. If you're not sure what difficulty to assign, {@difficulty average} works for any acceleration of natural healing, while anything similar in scope and impact to bringing the dead back to life should be {@difficulty daunting} or even {@difficulty formidable}.
