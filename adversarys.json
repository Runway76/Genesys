While most possess deep and ancient wisdoms, some have seemingly devolved into little more than beasts of hunger and fury. The fathomless seas that lay beyond the shores of Lorimor and the Torue Albes are home to one such strain, gigantic creatures that prey on seagoing vessels all along the western coast. Many sightings are reported even in the well-traveled southern waters separating Al-Kalim and Zanaga, a truly frightening occurrence for passengers. Experienced sailors, though, know that the true terrors are the gods that also live in the seas, and would rather face a wyrm any day.","While most vessels desperately seek to put as much distance as possible between a deepwyrm sighting and their own fragile vessels, others actually seek them out these creatures. Wyrm hunters are a breed apart, traveling in packs aboard chartered ships or accompanying merchant ships to offer defence in case of unexpected attacks. These brave individuals have a near ancestral hatred of the wyrms, and will even leap onto the backs of the creatures to ensure they are slain (even though it invariably means their own death). The scales and organs fetch high prices in Tamalir and Al-Medena, where alchemists use them for especially potent potions.","Some scholars (and pirates) firmly believe these creatures are not Dragonkin at all, but some other form of reptilian being perhaps utterly unique to the ocean depths. Those who have dared to venture into the Molten Heath or Isheim to ask the dragons directly have never returned, however."],"characteristics":{"brawn":5,"agility":4,"intellect":2,"cunning":3,"willpower":2,"presence":4},"derived":{"soak":9,"wounds":28,"strain":24,"defense":[1,1]},"skills":[{"name":"Brawl","characteristic":"brawn","ranks":4,"source":"crb"},{"name":"Discipline","characteristic":"willpower","ranks":3,"source":"crb"},{"name":"Resilience","characteristic":"brawn","ranks":4,"source":"crb"},{"name":"Vigilance","characteristic":"willpower","ranks":2,"source":"crb"}],"talents":["Adversary 1"],"abilities":["Amphibious","Silhouette 4","Terrifying 3"],"weapons":[{"name":"Massive Jaws","skill":{"name":"Brawl","source":"crb"},"damage":12,"critical":2,"range":"Engaged","qualities":[{"name":"Ensnare","ranks":2,"source":"crb"},{"name":"Vicious","ranks":4,"source":"crb"}]},{"name":"Tail and Fins","skill":{"name":"Brawl","source":"crb"},"damage":10,"critical":4,"range":"Engaged","qualities":[{"name":"Knockdown","source":"crb"}]}],"gear":[],"tags":["source:RoT","Official","setting:Fantasy","Combat CR:12","Social CR:3","General CR:3"],"settings":[{"name":"fantasy","source":"crb"},{"name":"Terrinoth"}]},{"name":"Xenomorph Horror","type":"rival","description":["On the countless planets in the galaxy, your characters are likely to encounter all manner of alien beasts.
